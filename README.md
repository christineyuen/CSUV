# CSUV package

This repository provides the implementation of the Combined Selection and Uncertainty Visualizer (CSUV). Details of the method can be found in C. Yuen and P. Fryzlewicz (2021). The main function is `csuv()`

Note currently the code may not be run as it depends on `relaxo` and `relaxo` is no longer available on CRAN. We will update the code and release the new version of CSUV.
